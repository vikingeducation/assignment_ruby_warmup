# string. Assume the input is only a single word 
# (e.g. "loot" not "William Shakespeare").

# # Download enable.txt, a popular Scrabble dictionary, 
# and load it in as your dictionary of choice. 
# If you haven't encountered Ruby's file I/O yet, 
# you can test your method by simply providing an 
# array of known anagrams like those below to check 
# that it works properly.

# # You can use Dir.pwd to output the current 
# directory. If you can't find the dictionary, 
# double check the directory you're executing your 
# script from within.
